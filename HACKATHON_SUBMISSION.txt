📝 PROJECT DESCRIPTION (147 words)
-----------------------------------
Persona Protocol is a Web3 wallet analysis system that transforms blockchain transaction data into actionable behavioral insights. By analyzing DeFi interactions, NFT activity, and protocol engagement patterns, it generates comprehensive persona profiles with three-dimensional scoring (Risk Appetite, Loyalty, Activity) and behavioral trait identification.

Built entirely using Vibe Coding with Kiro AI, the system processes wallet transactions through a five-stage pipeline: validation, analysis, scoring, persona generation, and output formatting. It identifies patterns like "Airdrop Hunter," "Diamond Hands," and "Protocol Specialist" to help DeFi platforms, wallet providers, and analytics services understand user behavior.

The project solves the challenge of making sense of complex on-chain data, enabling personalized experiences, risk assessment, and targeted engagement. With 49 passing tests and property-based validation, it's production-ready for integration into Web3 applications. Target users include DeFi platforms, wallet providers, analytics services, and blockchain researchers seeking behavioral insights.
